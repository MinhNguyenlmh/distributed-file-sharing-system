    + Establish and manage connections between peers, handling the IP address, port, and other connection details.
  - Peer Health Monitoring
    + Monitor the connection status and availability of connected peers, handling connection loss and reestablishing connections if necessary.
# 3. File Management Functions
  - File Indexing & Cataloging
    + Index files for efficient search and retrieval. Catalog files by metadata like name, type, size, hash, and availability.
  - File Chunking & Assembly
    + Divide large files into smaller chunks for parallel download and recombine them once all chunks are received.
  - Hashing & Verification
    + Generate and verify file hashes to ensure data integrity and prevent tampering or corruption.
  - File Metadata Management
    + Store and manage metadata such as file size, type, creator, description, and sharing history.
  - File Expiry & Cleanup
    + Automatically remove or archive files based on user-defined policies or inactivity thresholds.
# 4. Search & Discovery Functions
  - File Search by Keywords & Metadata
    + Allow users to search for files by keywords, file type, size, and other metadata.
  - Distributed Search Mechanism
    + Implement search across multiple peers without relying on a central server using distributed algorithms.
  - Search Result Ranking
    + Rank results based on popularity, availability, and relevance to the user’s search query.
# 5. File Sharing & Transfer

    + Allow users to share/upload files to the network, making them available to others.
  - Download Files
    + Enable users to download files from multiple peers, including resuming paused or interrupted downloads.
  - Parallel File Download
    +Support downloading file chunks in parallel from multiple peers to maximize download speeds.
  - Upload/Download Throttling
    + Manage bandwidth for both upload and download to optimize network performance.
# 6. Data Security & Privacy
  - Encryption
    + Encrypt data during transfer and, optionally, at rest, ensuring privacy for sensitive files.
  - Access Control
    + Provide access control features such as password-protected files or restricted access based on user role.
  - Anonymity Management
    + Enable anonymous sharing options, protecting users’ identities in the network.
# 7. Content Verification & Moderation
  - File Content Verification
    + Use hashing to verify the content's integrity and detect any malicious or corrupted files.
  - Report & Flag Inappropriate Content
    +Allow users to flag inappropriate or harmful content, which can be reviewed by moderators or the system.
  - Content Filtering
    + Implement filters to block certain types of files (e.g., based on file type or reported content).
# 8. Network Performance Optimization
  - Caching Mechanism
    + Cache frequently downloaded files or file chunks to reduce load on peers and improve access speed.
  - Load Balancing
    + Distribute file requests evenly among peers to prevent overload on any single peer.
  - Peer Connection Optimization
    + Prioritize connections with peers that offer high availability and good connection quality.
# 9. System Monitoring & Analytics
  - Real-Time System Monitoring
    + Monitor network health, traffic, peer availability, and active file shares.
  - Usage Analytics
    + Collect statistics like download/upload rates, popular files, and active users for system performance tracking.
  - Event Logging
    + Log important events, errors, and user actions for debugging and tracking purposes.
# 10. Messaging & Notification
  - Peer Messaging
    + Enable peer-to-peer messaging for coordination, chat, or notifications about file sharing.
  - System Notifications
    + Send alerts for download completion, failed connections, or other system events.
  - Offline Message Support
    + Queue and deliver messages when the peer reconnects if they were previously offline.
# 11. Resource Management
  - Bandwidth Management
    + Allow users to set upload/download limits to optimize network resource usage.
  - Storage Management
    + Monitor disk usage and allow users to configure storage limits for cache or shared files.
  - Energy Optimization
    + Implement energy-saving features for mobile or battery-powered devices, such as suspending non-essential services when the device is idle.
# 12. Backup & Recovery
  - Data Redundancy
    + Use data redundancy techniques to ensure files remain available even if some peers go offline.
  - File Restore & Reassembly
    + Support restoring incomplete or corrupted files from multiple peers.
  - Version Control
    + Allow for version control of files, so users can access or revert to older versions of shared files.
# 13. Administrative Functions
